# Before doing that, find out how to split a string into a list of words.

Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,
Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
The Heart-ache, and the thousand Natural shocks
That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,'''

#4 Below we show you how to construct lists and another data structure called a tuple
#  You already know quite a lot about lists, so play around with the list and the tuple
#  and try to figure out how tuples are different from lists.

# 1st way to construct a list
my_list = [1,2,3]
# 2nd way to construct a list
my_list = list([1,2,3])

# 1st way to construct a tuple
my_tuple = (1,2,3)
# 2nd way to construct a tuple
my_tuple = tuple([1,2,3])
